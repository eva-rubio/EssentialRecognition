AT&T database is one of the popular face database which is used to calculate the accuracy of face recognition system. 
The original AT&T face images are in "PGM" file format. 
The "PGM" files cannot open in some programming languages directly. 
Eg. Java cannot open PGM files and cannot convert it to BufferedImage object. 
So, the database files are converted into PNG files. 
This database is also known as: Olivetti - AT&T - ORL.
